# 🛒 React E-Commerce Website (Learning Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a fully functional **React-based E-Commerce Website** built during my early learning phase of React.

The primary goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of:

- Component-based architecture
- React state management
- Client-side routing
- API integration
- Project structuring best practices

The application simulates a basic online store experience, including product listings, search functionality, and dynamic page navigation.

> ⚠️ Note: This project was originally created around 3 years ago during my self-learning journey. I am re-uploading it as part of rebuilding my GitHub portfolio after losing access to my previous account.
