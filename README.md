🛒 React E-Commerce Website (Learning Project)

📌 Project Overview

This project was a fully functional e-commerce website built using React as part of my earlier learning phase. The main goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals, component-based architecture, routing, and API integration.

The application simulated a basic online store experience, including product listing, search functionality, and page navigation.
